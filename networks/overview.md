# Redes

We plan to create multiple long-lived, Moonbeam-based networks. Significantly, Moonbeam will be deployed to Kusama in addition to Polkadot.

Our roadmap in regards to deployments as a parachain is the following:

 - Moonbase Alpha: PureStake hosted parachain TestNet (_September 2020_) 
 - Moonrock: deployment on the Rococo TestNet (_tbd_)
 - Moonriver: deployment on Kusama (_end of Q2 2021_)
 - Moonbeam: deployment on Polkadot (_end of Q3 2021_)
 
This strategy allows us to de-risk software upgrades to Moonbeam on the Polkadot MainNet while still maintaining a reasonable update velocity. We will add details on how to access different Moonbeam-based networks as the networks become available.

## Moonbase Alpha

This TestNet is a network hosted by PureStake. It features a parachain/relay chain scheme. The goal is to allow developers to test the Ethereum compatibility features of Moonbeam in a shared parachain environment without needing to run their own nodes or network.

## Moonrock  

We have decided not to participate in the first parachain deployments to Rococo. We have been running our own parachain/relay chain setup since we launched our TestNet in September 2020.

However, we expect to deploy Moonbeam as a parachain on the Rococo TestNet once interoperability features become available. This will provide a place to test these features with other chains.

## Moonriver

Moonbeam will launch as a parachain on the Kusama network, in advance of deploying to the Polkadot MainNet ([more details here](https://www.purestake.com/news/moonbeam-on-kusama/)). This requires parachain functionality to be live on Kusama. 

We plan to exercise parachain-related functionality such as [Crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans), [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crosschain), and [SPREE](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-spree) on Moonriver as those features become available.

## Moonbeam Polkadot MainNet

The Moonbeam production MainNet will be deployed as a parachain on Polkadot. This Moonbeam network will feature the highest levels of security and availability. Code running on the MainNet will generally have been vetted through one or more of the other networks listed above.
